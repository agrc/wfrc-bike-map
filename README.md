## Development Environment

### Set Up

1. Install app dependencies `pnpm install`
1. Duplicate `functions/.secrets.local.sample` as `.secrets.local` and fill in the values.
1. Duplicate `functions/.env.sample` as `.env.local` and fill in the values.

## Deploy

This website is tested and deployed with GitHub Actions.

## Remote Configs

This app is configurable via [Firebase Remote Configs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config). This allows admins to update various parts of the application without having to deploy a new build.

[Dev Configs](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ut-dts-agrc-wfrc-bike-map-dev/config/env/firebase)
[Prod Configs](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ut-dts-agrc-wfrc-bike-map-prod/config/env/firebase)

Once any changes are published, the values should be reflected in the corresponding application environment within 60 seconds.

If you add a new config, make sure to run `pnpm run download-configs:dev` so that you have the necessary default values during development. This is done automatically in CI.

[!NOTE]
JSON values can only contain a single level object. Nested objects are not supported by the react context component in this app at the moment.
